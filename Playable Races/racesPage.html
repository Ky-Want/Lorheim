          <p>Humans. The number one most prolific humanoid race on the planet. Considering the nature of their

            extinct by
            now, but no. They're somehow just as stubbornly adaptive as they are prolific.</p><br>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +1 to three stats of your choosing <br>
          Adaptive: You can start in any location of your choosing and take no debuffs from your home environment (eg.
          If you
          start in the dessert you'll get advantage on saves to withstand extreme heat, but disadvantage to withstand
          the cold) <br><br>

          <p>Deep within the world dwells the race of dwarves. They are famous for being as hardy and stubborn as
            the stone they
            build their cities from, along with their incredible craftsmanship. Speaking of craftsmanship, their talent
            for it has
            nothing to do with skill or any kind of training, though they do hone their craft to perfection. Rather,
            their ability
            to shape the stones and metals of Loreheim comes from their reproductive instincts. When a female dwarf is
            ready to have
            a child they travel to the "Core" with family and sometimes very close friends. The core is a living mass of
            stone that
            carries high quantities of mana. Each community has a core, and every dwarf who lives around the core was
            carved from
            it. When a new dwarf is being carved the relatives will stand guard and watch until the mother is done
            shaping her new
            child, and once they are fully formed the watchers will each have the chance to carve a rune upon the
            child's body
            representing a positive trait (eg. Strong, bold, loyal, etc.). Once done the core will "breathe life" into
            the child and
            the mother will return to the community and raise the child to adulthood. The entire process is considered a
            sacred
            tradition that not even all relatives are guaranteed a chance to witness. No one really knows how or why the
            process
            works, and no outsider has ever been allowed close enough to study it.
            As the children grow the marks given to them take on the appearance of tattoos while they make the
            transition of stone
            to flesh over the course of a week or two.</p><br><br>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>

          Child of stone: +2 to Con saves vs poisons and drugs <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Alien: Many of the more "natural" races think of you as alien and unnatural due to your origins and may not be
          very

          <p>The Fae come in many shapes and sizes depending on the race they mutated from after the Astre fell to their
            continent
            and brought their unique mana with them. This variety ranges from the savage western Orcs all the way to the
            now extinct
            Elves and some who's race of origin is indiscernible, such as the bone and tooth fae. Below are a few of the
            possible
            variants you could play as, but be warned, you won't be welcomed with open arms by many of the civilized
            races
            (especially humans) due to your otherworldly, and in some cases, disturbing nature. Among their many unique
            traits a
            common one all fae share is that they stop aging upon reaching maturity. Their growth rates differ based
            upon their race
            of origin, but it always stops once they're mature. Just as with all other mortals they can still perish to
            illness,
            injury, and other natural causes excluding age.
          </p><br><br><br>

          <!-- elven fae -->
          <p>Elven Fae: Having originated from the now extinct race of elves, elven fae retained the ethereal beauty
            elves
            used to be
            famous for and then some. Much like the rest of their kind, these fae have a penchant for meat, but to a
            much
            higher and
            more magical degree than the others like them. Through the years these fae have developed the ability to
            consume the
            memories of those they cannibalize. While most other sentient races view this as a horrifying act, the fae
            simply see it
            as a special tradition and a great responsibility to carry on the memories of those before them.</p>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +2 cha, +1 con <br>
          Consume: When consuming the flesh of a newly deceased humanoid you can gain flashes of various memories from
          the beings
          past. WARNING, just because you can eat raw flesh doesn't mean you're immune to diseases that can be
          transmitted by
          corpses and certain body parts. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Cannibal: You're a monster in the eyes of the people despite your unparalleled beauty. If you're recognized as
          an elven
          fae you will, at best, be avoided like the plague, and at worst driven out of the community with torches,
          pitchforks,
          and death threats.

          <br><br><br>

          <!-- Irkyne -->
          <p>Irkyne: The Irkyne are a group of warrior fae that roam the Fae Isle in clans. These fearsome creatures
            were
            born from
            orcs and similarly large and intimidating races. They are most well known for their hulking size, often
            standing upwards
            of seven feet tall with varying shades of skin ranging from blue to green to even obsidian black in some
            cases. That
            paired with their horns that differ from group to group makes them quite the terrifying opponent.</p>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +3 str, +1 con, -1 cha <br>
          Brute: What you lack in charm you more than make up for in shear size and strength. Gain a +2 to strength
          based checks
          and saves. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Beast: Your strange and fearsome appearance makes even the bravest of souls wary of you.

          <br><br><br>

          <!-- Nixie -->
          <p>Nixie: These small creatures stand typically around three to four feet tall and bear the appearance of wild
            children who
            were raised by nature herself. While they look humanoid, their origins are a mystery and they also give off
            the unique
            feeling most fae do, often making the few who have the luck (or misfortune) of meeting one instantly on
            edge. Upon
            closer inspection they have been noted to have large eyes that reflect light and green tinted skin. The
            vines, leaves,
            and sometimes moss that many assume to have caught in their hair actually grows from it naturally.</p>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +1 dex, +2 wis <br>
          Nature's favorite: As a Nixie you are gifted with the ability to hear the voices of animals and plants. While
          you can't
          speak the same language as the animals and plants (rendering communication impossible) you can get a general
          idea of
          what they're trying to communicate most of the time. Survival checks are made with a +2 and animals are more
          friendly
          towards you as long as you aren't actively appearing as a threat to them. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Uncivilized: Speaking with civilized races isn't your strong suite, so checks that require you to interact
          with people
          are made with a -2.

          <p>There are two variations of Lizardfolk. The Valkin and the Ferin. The Valkin live in extremely humid areas,
            like the
            jungles of NosVite. They come in almost every color known to man and grow a similarly vibrant array of
            feathers on the
            back of their head and carry lethal poisons that they use to strike down prey and enemies alike. Valkin tend
            to live in
            small tribes in homes built high above the ground using woven together branches to form their nests. They're
            also
            extremely territorial and aggressive. The Ferin are more partial to living on the coasts near settlements.
            They often do
            trade with small part towns and cities who benefit from the added security of living in coexistence with the
            Ferin.
            While much more easy going than their Valkin cousins, the Ferin are just as capable of violence, if not more
            so. Also
            unlike the Valkin, Ferin come in dull blue and grey hues and are built more for swimming than climbing.

          <strong>Valkin</strong><br>
          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +2 str, +1 con <br>
          Poisonous: 1/day you can make a normal melee attack to bite a creature. If you succeed, the enemy must make a
          con save
          or suffer 1d6 + con poison damage until they make their save, get cured, or die. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Violent: As the name of the trait states, you're kind are known for incredible violence, especially when it
          comes to
          territorial disputes. This has led to some unfortunate situations and a general distrust among the other races
          towards
          your kind. <br><br><br>

          Adept swimmer: Having lived in the water all your life you've gotten used to swimming at top speeds to keep
          away from
          predators or to catch fish. Your swim speed is the same as your walking speed and you can hold your breath for
          up to
          three hours. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Aquatic: Ferin tend to spend more time under water than not, so it's usually quite uncomfortable to be on land
          for them
          and takes a lot of time to adjust to the change in environment.

          <p>The Astre are heavenly beings with large white wings and red eyes, otherwise appearing similar to humans.
            It is said
            that they were created when Itris plucked the brightest and most beautiful stars from the sky and shaped
            them into souls
            before placing them within the vessels she had created for her perfect soldiers. The Astre were created with
            the sole
            purpose of being her hands, eyes, shields, and swords in the mortal realm. They offered guidance to their
            goddesses
            chosen few and struck down those who offended her. This is how it always was, and how it seemed it would
            always be,
            until one day a handful of Astre started to become frustrated with the way they were being treated, as if
            they were mere
            tools and nothing more. They confronted their goddess over the matter, and as a result she became enraged
            and threw them
            down from the Celestial realm, Regna Caelum. These fallen Astre now wander Loreheim, some seeking
            redemption, some
            revenge, and some simply wander aimlessly without any purpose.</p><br>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +1 wis, +1 con <br>
          Burning soul: Despite being fallen, you still retain the flaming essence you were created with. You have
          resistance to
          fire and 1/day you can deal an extra 1d4 fire damage with a melee attack. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          Fallen: You have fallen from Itris' grace, and thus she has clipped your wings. While you can glide small
          distances at a
          time, you can't fly and are shunned by her followers.

          <p>As they have with every other race, the humans have mingled with fae, since they seem to have no sense of
            self
            preservation. These occasional unions have spawned very few offspring, but there have still been some
            successful cases.
            The human blood in these offspring have diluted the mutations just enough to make them look somewhat more
            normal, but
            the traces of the fae bloodline isn't erased entirely. These beings have a variety of traits inherited from
            their fae
            blood including but not limited to slightly finer features, skin tinted in unnatural looking shades, the
            small
            beginnings of horns, larger frames, and more.</p><br>

          <strong>BENEFITS:</strong><br>
          +2 Dex, and +2 to any stat of your choice or +1 to two stats <br>
          Keen senses: Having come from a line with unnatural senses, you inherited some improvements to your vision,
          hearing, and
          other senses. Gain +2 to perception. <br>
          Eternal bloodline: Fae Kin share how they age with their fae relatives, that being that they don't age a bit
          after
          reaching full maturity. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS:</strong><br>
          -2 Con. While humans are technically compatible with some fae, it doesn't necessarily mean they should
          procreate.
          Children that come from such a union tend to have minor complications with their health. Usually it's nothing
          serious
          enough to be life threatening, but it does make life inconvenient at the best of times.

          <p>A warforged is created when a soul is artificially placed inside a construct with the proper enchantments
            and runes to
            replicate a living entity without actually being a living entity. The warforged, as they are now called, are
            beings made
            of metal, wood, and occasionally other materials. Early into the development of the mage kingdoms on Airith
            the
            warforged were made for farm work or household chores and similar tasks. Some were designed for more
            complicated jobs,
            but for the most part they were created with the intention of making it easier for the mages of Airith to
            focus on their
            research. Once the war broke out they were repurposed, and after the massive magical explosion that tore
            apart the
            continent some made it out intact enough to continue functioning, and of those who made it out a few gained
            sentience
            through varying means.</p><br>

          <strong>BENEFITS</strong><br>
          +2 con, and +1 to one other ability of your choosing <br>
          Mechanical being: Due to your inhuman nature you have no need to eat, drink, or breath. On top of that you are
          immune to
          disease and when taking a long rest you only need to spend 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state. When
          inactive you
          can still see and hear as normal. <br><br>

          <strong>DRAWBACKS</strong><br>
          Unfeeling: Being a non-living creature has its upsides, but it also has some downsides. One of these downsides
          being a
          lack of emotion. Where normal creatures can at least feel basic fear, happiness, and pain, you feel nothing.
          This makes
          beings of the fleshy variety very difficult to interact with at times.
