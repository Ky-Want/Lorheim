            <strong>A couple quick notes on magic:</strong>
            <p>First of all, magic in this setting will be run using a point based system rather than spell slots.
              Basically, players will get a certain number of points per day to spend on spells and spell-like
              abilities. There isn't
              a set amount of damage dice, buffs, etc. that will determine the exact outcome every time. Instead there
              will be a base line and a number of points it costs
              to use that
              spell or ability. Players can use more points than needed to increase the spells potency, but should be
              wary of going
              overboard
              since points can't be regained until after a long rest.
            </p>

            <p>Magic users will be very limited due to the Rift Crisis. As such the general population will mainly be
              made up of those
              who can use martial magic (alchemists, rune keepers, rogues, juggernauts, etc.).
              Magic casters
              will be highly limited and sought after if they are found out.
            </p>
            <p>Similar to Arcane mages, Naturae mages will be sought out if discovered as well, but rather than for the
              purpose of
              being recruited into the military they will most likely be either imprisoned or exterminated due to the
              high risk they
              pose to what civilizations remain.</p>

            <strong>Souls</strong>
            <br>
            Souls exist in every living thing, they are what separates the living from the
            dead. As a creature develops and grows, so to does it's soul. Not all souls are the same though, much like
            certain
            evolutionary traits some souls grow and develop to the point of being flexible and capable of processing
            things like
            mana, like a mages soul, while some remain in a set state and only exist to prove that a creature is
            alive.
            Plants are a
            good example of this. Every living plant has a soul, and while these souls aren't flexible enough to
            manipulate magic,
            they do still take in mana. Though, the way they take in mana is a little different for some. For some
            plants, namely
            alchemical ones, they have evolved to absorb some of the mana that enters their soul like they would
            nutrients,
            resulting in the various types of plants useable in potions.
            <br><br>
            Souls are kind of like a bunch of wires. They act as a magnet and conduit for
            mana.
            Normally, mana would simply enter the soul and leave without any change, but when a soul is developed and
            flexible
            enough it can process the mana into something more useful.
            <br><br>
            Now for the reason souls act like magnets for arcane mana. This one is rather simple, the reason for this
            is
            Naturae
            mana, or the essence of souls. Naturae and arcane mana are fundamentally different, but also just similar
            enough to not
            clash with each other like moody siblings whenever they come into contact with one another. When arcane
            mana
            encounters
            naturae mana, it's drawn in, but once it enters the thing giving off that essence, the naturae mana
            naturally pushes it
            out rather than mixing, much like oil and water.
            <br><br>
            Each soul is different, so there's always going to be a special case, but these are the base rules for
            souls.
            <!-- #endregion -->

            <!-- #region: Magic entry -->
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            <strong>Magic</strong>
            <br>
            Magic is broken up into three primary categories. Arcane, Naturae, and Martial.
            <br><br>
            Arcane mana is an invisible substance that permeates the air and flows through every realm in existence.
            Souls naturally
            draw this substance in like a magnet, only for it to flow back out again in a never ending cycle. Not many
            can harness
            it, but all have at least some Arcane mana traveling through their soul at all times. Mages are capable of
            manipulating
            their souls to take hold of Arcane mana and shape it while it's leaving their body. The way they shape it
            defines how
            the mana is processed and what kind of spell they end up using, and the size and power of their soul
            dictates how
            powerful the spell can be. Attempting to cast a spell more powerful than your soul can handle can tear it
            apart.
            Similarly if you use too much magic in too short a time span you will wear down your soul and eventually
            either become
            unable to cast magic, or enter a comatose state. In the worst case scenario overworking your soul could
            also lead to
            death.
            <br><br>
            The next type of magic is known as Naturae, or life magic for the plebians out there. It's a unique type
            of mana that,
            rather than simply existing, is produced by all living things. It is also exceedingly dangerous. In using
            Naturae one
            could take control of a life, bring the wrath of nature itself down on some poor fucker, or even summon
            the dead to head your commands in
            some cases. Due to the dangerous and unpredictable nature of Naturae magic most have become quite wary of
            those who can
            wield it.
            <br><br>
            Finally we have Martial magic. By altering the shape of their soul they can change the course of the mana
            flowing
            through their bodies, giving them some additional advantages over the classes that can actually utilize
            actual magic.
            <br>
            WARNING: attempting to change the fundamental shape of your soul is a VERY bad idea unless you know
            EXACTLY what you're
            doing.
            When a mage uses magic they use their soul to process the mana inside of them and shape it on it's way out
            to form their
            target spell, they don't actually do anything that changes or moves the soul unnaturally. The reason it's
            so dangerous
            to change the shape of the soul is because when you do you could cause mana blockages in the body,
            resulting in affects
            similar to if you poured lead into a person's bloodstream. Mana becomes very volatile when forced to hold
            still in one
            spot. On top of essentially poisoning the person, as it condenses due to the blockage and gains a high
            enough
            concentration it can also begin processing on it's own, resulting in additional random effect(s) or just
            mutating the
            body of the individual, kind of like wild magic. That is, assuming they live long enough to get to that
            stage and don't
            seek help from a highly skilled healer to fix their soul. So anything from transforming into a monster to
            exploding into
            a massive fireball can happen.
            Moral of the story? Don't fuck with souls. You won't like what happens.

            Anyone who has the capability to wield magic can form the familiar bond with any willing creature of

            that can't be easily broken as it links your soul with the soul of the creature. The familiar will gain

            You can try to bond with beasts of 8 or lower intelligence that you encounter by making an animal handling
            check against the CR of a
            creature +
            its Attitude modifier (indicated below). On a successful check, you have bonded with the beast. Bonded
            creatures
            are loyal to you, but still have a will of their own and can choose to attempt to shatter the bond.
            Additional changes to the DC can and will be made at the discretion of the DM depending on the situation.
            <br><br>
            Aggressive = 22 -or- Defensive = 18
            <br><br>
            Indifferent = 14
            <br><br>
            Friendly = 11
            <br><br>
            You can only perform a check on a creature to improve its attitude once per hour. If you fail you have to
            wait an hour
            to try again. In this way, to calm a creature from Aggressive or Defensive to Friendly, it would take 3
            successful checks
            over 2 hours.
            <br>
            After the beast has become friendly you must spend 1d6 + creature CR hours meditating to achieve a full
            bond. If you're
            interrupted during this process you'll have to start over.
            <br><br>
            Intelligent bonds:
            If you wish to bond with a creature with 10 or higher intellect similar rules will apply, but rather than
            animal
            handling checks, you'll be making persuasion checks. The creature must also be completely willing, and for
            some they won't be
            willing to bond with a person no
            matter how high the player roles. Since they have intelligence they will understand that they'll be in a
            subservient
            position, and not all entities are willing to serve anyone but themselves.

            <p>The templates I use to build my monsters comes from <a href="https://ebshimizu.github.io/5emm/#/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Falindrith's Monster Maker</a>.</p><br><br>

            <strong>Balancing Enemy HP:</strong><br>
            <p>First, calculate the average damage output for the party. Each party member has two actions, so if there
              are three party members then about 4 to 6 attacks will be made each turn on average most likely. Taking
              into account the dice being fickle about 3 attacks should hit each round. Lets say each attack has the
              ability to do 6 damage, that'll be about 18. So a good average would be 9
              damage per turn.</p>
            <p>Now to determine how long the enemy should last. On average I like combat to last between 6 and 8 rounds.
              So, if the party is doing about 9 damage per round the enemy should have between 54 and 72 health.</p>
            <br><br>

            <strong>Balancing Enemy Damage Output</strong>
            <p>Applying the same per turn damage logic for determining an enemies health, you need to take total health
              of the front line party member(s) and compare it to how long they need to last in order to not die. If
              there is one front liner and they have 20 max HP and the fight should last for 6 to 8 rounds then the
              enemy should be doing 3 to 4 damage each turn, so each attack should do 1 to 2 damage.</p>
            <p>Now, obviously there could be a lot more factors than that. Lets say there are two front liners and they
              each have 20 max HP. With the previously mentioned desired 6 to 8 round combats and the enemy splitting
              it's attention between the two the damage should be increased to reflect the higher survivability the
              party members might have by being able to share the damage without making it too easy. Using the same
              average as before we could probably increase the damage for each attack to about 2 to 3.</p>

            <p>So the way levels are going to work will be similar to normal D&D, but also kind of not. When you gain
              enough XP, you
              level up and get a selection of active and passive abilities to choose from. <br><br>

              For example... <br>
              Level 1: 3 actives, 2 passives, and any class features <br>
              Level 2: 1 upgrade point, and 1 stat point <br>
              Level 3: 2 actives, 1 passive <br><br>

              Actives are like spells and abilities, like fireball for example, and passives will be passive effects
              that help the
              characters in much more minor ways, like a small boost to certain types of damage, or darkvision out of
              10ft. Stuff like
              that. <br>
              Finally, upgrade points can be used to level up an active or passive you've already taken, or you can use
              it to
              gain a new active or passive from lower levels.</p>


            <p>Every level is 150 experience apart, the reason for this is that the more experienced you gain, the
              less you have to learn. Thus, as players progress and fight their way through life they will have to adapt
              and get more creative in order to gain more experience. They'll have to try new things and put in actual
              effort
              to get further along.</p>
            <p>The way I'll be handing out XP will be based upon the players actions. Everything action and encounter
              has the potential to grant XP, but only if the players work for it. Due to that XP will be rewarded based
              upon a players actions rather than a set amount.</p>
