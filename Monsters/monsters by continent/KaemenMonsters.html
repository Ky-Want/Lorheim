          The clockwork war beasts of Kaemen, otherwise known as Mecanica, are a unique breed in a unique category all
          their own. Around 205 BR they were created
          by carefully merging a rare organic metal with living creatures with the help of some leaked information on
          Warforged. It took some time to perfect, but in the end the desert
          people had created a near perfect creature of war. The majority of these creatures were reserved for the use
          of war should it come about, while the others who weren't meant specifically for war were most frequently used
          for protection when traversing the scorching sands of their home land. Now the majority of them run wild with
          the demons that have overrun Kaemen while the others had long since been sent overseas
          and sold off as novelty pets and guard animals. The ones that run wild were Mecanica that escaped or simply
          wandered off after their owners were killed while fighting demons.

          <br><br>

          Mecanica take many different shapes, but the most common are wolf-like in appearance, on top of
          that due to
          the unique organic nature of the metal these creatures are made of, the metal is reproduced and consistently
          appears in
          the next generations.

          <br><br>

          If a clockwork beast is bred with something completely organic the metal still appears in their young and
          usually
          enhances the offspring's strength and other natural abilities, but there's also about a 30% chance the young
          will be
          born either dead or severely debilitated. This happens when the metal forms wrong in their body or simply
          rejects the
          other half of their genetics. If the half breed offspring survives and grows up healthy the chance of their
          young coming
          into the world disabled or deceased increases to 60% due to the metal in their bloodline becoming more
          unstable.
