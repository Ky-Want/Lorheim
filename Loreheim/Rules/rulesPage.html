              Souls exist in every living thing, they are what separates the living from the
              dead. As a creature develops and grows, so to does it's soul. Not all souls are the same though, much like
              certain
              evolutionary traits some souls grow and develop to the point of being flexible and capable of processing
              things like
              mana, like a mages soul, while some remain in a set state and only exist to prove that a creature is
              alive.
              Plants are a
              good example of this. Every living plant has a soul, and while these souls aren't flexible enough to
              manipulate magic,
              they do still take in mana. Though, the way they take in mana is a little different for some. For some
              plants, namely
              alchemical ones, they have evolved to absorb some of the mana that enters their soul like they would
              nutrients,
              resulting in the various types of plants useable in potions.
              <br><br>
              Souls are kind of like a bunch of wires. They act as a magnet and conduit for
              mana.
              Normally, mana would simply enter the soul and leave without any change, but when a soul is developed and
              flexible
              enough it can process the mana into something more useful.
              <br><br>
              Now for the reason souls act like magnets for arcane mana. This one is rather simple, the reason for this
              is
              Naturae
              mana, or the essence of souls. Naturae and arcane mana are fundamentally different, but also just similar
              enough to not
              clash with each other like moody siblings whenever they come into contact with one another. When arcane
              mana
              encounters
              naturae mana, it's drawn in, but once it enters the thing giving off that essence, the naturae mana
              naturally pushes it
              out rather than mixing, much like oil and water.
              <br><br>
              Each soul is different, so there's always going to be a special case, but these are the base rules for
              souls.

            <i class="fs-5">
              <br>
              Magic is broken up into three primary categories. Arcane, Naturae, and Martial.
              <br><br>
              Arcane mana is an invisible substance that permeates the air and flows through every realm in existence.
              Souls naturally
              draw this substance in like a magnet, only for it to flow back out again in a never ending cycle. Not many
              can harness
              it, but all have at least some Arcane mana traveling through their soul at all times. Mages are capable of
              manipulating
              their souls to take hold of Arcane mana and shape it while it's leaving their body. The way they shape it
              defines how
              the mana is processed and what kind of spell they end up using, and the size and power of their soul
              dictates how
              powerful the spell can be. Attempting to cast a spell more powerful than your soul can handle can tear it
              apart.
              Similarly if you use too much magic in too short a time span you will wear down your soul and eventually
              either become
              unable to cast magic, or enter a comatose state. In the worst case scenario overworking your soul could
              also lead to
              death.
              <br><br>
              The next type of magic is known as Naturae, or life magic for the plebians out there. It's a unique type
              of mana that,
              rather than simply existing, is produced by all living things. It is also exceedingly dangerous. In using
              Naturae one
              could take control of a life, bring the wrath of nature itself down on some poor fucker, or even summon
              the dead to head your commands in
              some cases. Due to the dangerous and unpredictable nature of Naturae magic most have become quite wary of
              those who can
              wield it.
              <br><br>
              Finally we have Martial magic. By altering the shape of their soul they can change the course of the mana
              flowing
              through their bodies, giving them some additional advantages over the classes that can actually utilize
              actual magic.
              <br>
              WARNING: attempting to change the fundamental shape of your soul is a VERY bad idea unless you know
              EXACTLY what you're
              doing.
              When a mage uses magic they use their soul to process the mana inside of them and shape it on it's way out
              to form their
              target spell, they don't actually do anything that changes or moves the soul unnaturally. The reason it's
              so dangerous
              to change the shape of the soul is because when you do you could cause mana blockages in the body,
              resulting in affects
              similar to if you poured lead into a person's bloodstream. Mana becomes very volatile when forced to hold
              still in one
              spot. On top of essentially poisoning the person, as it condenses due to the blockage and gains a high
              enough
              concentration it can also begin processing on it's own, resulting in additional random effect(s) or just
              mutating the
              body of the individual, kind of like wild magic. That is, assuming they live long enough to get to that
              stage and don't
              seek help from a highly skilled healer to fix their soul. So anything from transforming into a monster to
              exploding into
              a massive fireball can happen.
              Moral of the story? Don't fuck with souls. You won't like what happens.
