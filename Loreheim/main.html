        Welcome to Loreheim. A world of magic, mayhem, and mystery. The date is 500 AR, and the world is in shambles.
        Why, you might ask? Well, that's both quite simple and complicated and starts thousands of years in the past
        when many mages were shunned for their powers. Some of these mages decided they'd had enough of being
        mistreated
        and simply wanted to live in peace with their studies. These first few flocked to the uncharted continent that
        would later come to be known as Airith. There, they formed a council of mages and set up barriers around their
        lands to prevent any external disruptions. Over the years more and more magically inclined scholars left for
        the great continent, in hopes of sharing and gaining
        knowledge in peace. This whole exchange was going extremely well and led to some incredible inventions and
        discoveries,
        however, as everyone knows, it is in human nature to be greedy. Over the years members of this advanced,
        magical
        society
        became steadily more irritable at the lack of ownership over their creations since all knowledge was shared
        equally and
        given freely to The Magnus Librarium. This great library acted as the centerpiece of their incredible society.
        But, as
        more time passed, more individuals began withholding their findings, only leading to more outrage and more
        conflict until
        tensions finally reached a peak and erupted into an all out war. The mages war was bloody, brutal, and drawn
        out
        over
        the span of a few years as they began fighting amongst themselves before splitting into different factions and
        trying to
        eliminate the other factions. This war drew to a close with one final ditch effort from every mage faction,
        each
        one
        throwing every weapon, magical and otherwise, at the others, resulting in a magical explosion that rocked the
        entire
        continent with the force of several nukes. The aftermath of the clash was about as could be expected. 90% of
        the
        continent was shattered and later nicknamed "The Floating Isles," due to the effect the magical turmoil had on
        the
        land. Once
        it was deemed safe to begin exploring by the outside world it was noted that a rift had formed at the center
        of
        Airith
        where the most damage had been done by the final all out attack. This rift is the reason behind the current
        state of the
        world. After being discovered it was also found out that the rift led to another realm known as Regnum
        Infernum,
        home to
        the demonic races. What followed was nothing short of a massacre as the volatile magic still floating around
        slowly
        opened the rift further and further, letting in wave after wave of demonic creatures that wanted nothing more
        than to
        slaughter and destroy everything in their path. Now, 500 years after the rift was discovered, Loreheim faces
        its
        destruction. As the rift only gets bigger, every country on every surrounding continent is scrambling to find
        more mages
        to help fix it and kill off the ever growing population of demon kind continuing to wreak havoc on their
        lands,
        but things are looking unfortunately grim.
