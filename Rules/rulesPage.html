            <strong>Souls</strong>
            <br>
            Souls exist in every living thing, they are what separates the living from the
            dead. As a creature develops and grows, so to does it's soul. Not all souls are the same though, much like
            certain
            evolutionary traits some souls grow and develop to the point of being flexible and capable of processing
            things like
            mana, like a mages soul, while some remain in a set state and only exist to prove that a creature is
            alive.
            Plants are a
            good example of this. Every living plant has a soul, and while these souls aren't flexible enough to
            manipulate magic,
            they do still take in mana. Though, the way they take in mana is a little different for some. For some
            plants, namely
            alchemical ones, they have evolved to absorb some of the mana that enters their soul like they would
            nutrients,
            resulting in the various types of plants useable in potions.
            <br><br>
            Souls are kind of like a bunch of wires. They act as a magnet and conduit for
            mana.
            Normally, mana would simply enter the soul and leave without any change, but when a soul is developed and
            flexible
            enough it can process the mana into something more useful.
            <br><br>
            Now for the reason souls act like magnets for arcane mana. This one is rather simple, the reason for this
            is
            Naturae
            mana, or the essence of souls. Naturae and arcane mana are fundamentally different, but also just similar
            enough to not
            clash with each other like moody siblings whenever they come into contact with one another. When arcane
            mana
            encounters
            naturae mana, it's drawn in, but once it enters the thing giving off that essence, the naturae mana
            naturally pushes it
            out rather than mixing, much like oil and water.
            <br><br>
            Each soul is different, so there's always going to be a special case, but these are the base rules for
            souls.

            <!-- #region: Magic entry -->
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            <strong>Magic</strong>
            <br>
            Magic is broken up into three primary categories. Arcane, Naturae, and Martial.
            <br><br>
            Arcane mana is an invisible substance that permeates the air and flows through every realm in existence.
            Souls naturally
            draw this substance in like a magnet, only for it to flow back out again in a never ending cycle. Not many
            can harness
            it, but all have at least some Arcane mana traveling through their soul at all times. Mages are capable of
            manipulating
            their souls to take hold of Arcane mana and shape it while it's leaving their body. The way they shape it
            defines how
            the mana is processed and what kind of spell they end up using, and the size and power of their soul
            dictates how
            powerful the spell can be. Attempting to cast a spell more powerful than your soul can handle can tear it
            apart.
            Similarly if you use too much magic in too short a time span you will wear down your soul and eventually
            either become
            unable to cast magic, or enter a comatose state. In the worst case scenario overworking your soul could
            also lead to
            death.
            <br><br>
            The next type of magic is known as Naturae, or life magic for the plebians out there. It's a unique type
            of mana that,
            rather than simply existing, is produced by all living things. It is also exceedingly dangerous. In using
            Naturae one
            could take control of a life, bring the wrath of nature itself down on some poor fucker, or even summon
            the dead to head your commands in
            some cases. Due to the dangerous and unpredictable nature of Naturae magic most have become quite wary of
            those who can
            wield it.
            <br><br>
            Finally we have Martial magic. By altering the shape of their soul they can change the course of the mana
            flowing
            through their bodies, giving them some additional advantages over the classes that can actually utilize
            actual magic.
            <br>
            WARNING: attempting to change the fundamental shape of your soul is a VERY bad idea unless you know
            EXACTLY what you're
            doing.
            When a mage uses magic they use their soul to process the mana inside of them and shape it on it's way out
            to form their
            target spell, they don't actually do anything that changes or moves the soul unnaturally. The reason it's
            so dangerous
            to change the shape of the soul is because when you do you could cause mana blockages in the body,
            resulting in affects
            similar to if you poured lead into a person's bloodstream. Mana becomes very volatile when forced to hold
            still in one
            spot. On top of essentially poisoning the person, as it condenses due to the blockage and gains a high
            enough
            concentration it can also begin processing on it's own, resulting in additional random effect(s) or just
            mutating the
            body of the individual, kind of like wild magic. That is, assuming they live long enough to get to that
            stage and don't
            seek help from a highly skilled healer to fix their soul. So anything from transforming into a monster to
            exploding into
            a massive fireball can happen.
            Moral of the story? Don't fuck with souls. You won't like what happens.

            Anyone who has the capability to wield magic can form the familiar bond with any willing creature of
            similar strength.
            The process can take upwards of multiple days of meditation to complete, but once created the familiar
            bond is something
            that can't be easily broken as it links your soul with the soul of the creature. The familiar will gain
            new abilities
            and strength as it draws its power from you to grow. Familiars level with you gain special abilities
            related to your own

            Familiars have the ability to communicate mentally with it's soul bonded, on top of that you can look
            through your

            After the beast has become friendly you must spend 1d6 + creature CR hours meditating to achieve a full

            handling you'll be making persuasion checks. The creature must also be willing, and for some they won't be
            willing no
            matter how high the player roles. Since they have intelligence they will understand that they'll be in a
